3. Basic User Experience: Users can type numbers, operators, and perform calculations seamlessly.
Structure:


The project adheres to a well-organized structure with three main files:
1. index.html: This file forms the foundation of your calculator's user interface (UI). It leverages HTML to create the overall layout, including the display area, buttons, and any other visual elements.
2. style.css: This file houses the CSS styles that define the visual appearance of your calculator. You can customize fonts, colors, button styles, and other design aspects here.
3. script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code, the heart of the calculator's functionality. It handles user interaction with buttons, processes calculations, and updates the display accordingly.
